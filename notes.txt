First React project built with the help of React crash course by Traversy Media

#----- Folder Structure -----
./public folder contains the main index.html file
./src folder contains the index.js, App component (default) and it's css, index.css etc...

#----- JSX -----
Change the  language mode from JavaScript to JavaScript JSX (javascriptreact), to get the Emmet support in JSX
JSX Expressions must have one parent element. So use a <div> to wrap, or <> & </>
Also, import {React} and use <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>
